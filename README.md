# WeatherSite🌦️

🎯 A website that will show you how the weather is. It was made for me to understand how the APIs work and test my knowledge

❗To access the site's features, follow these steps:

1️⃣ Access the **OpenWeather** website through the link below 👇🏼 and log in (register if necessary):  
🔗 https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys  

2️⃣ After that, create your **API_KEY** and click generate  

3️⃣ Then perform a **'git clone'** of this repository and replace the value of **'const API_KEY = "🤫secret"'**, located on the first line of the **app.js** file, with **your API key** (Ex. **'const API_KEY = "123456";'**)  

4️⃣ You're done!🥳
