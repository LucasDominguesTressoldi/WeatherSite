# WeatherSite🌦️

🎯 A website that will show you how the weather is. It was made for me to understand how the APIs work and test my knowledge

❗To access the site's features, follow these steps:

👉🏼 Access the **OpenWeather** website through the link below 👇🏼 and log in (register if necessary):  
🔗 https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys

👉🏼 After that, create your **API_KEY** and click generate

👉🏼 Then perform a **'git clone'** of this repository and replace the value of **'const API_KEY = "🤫secret"'**, located on the first line of the **app.js** file, with **your API key** (Ex. **'const API_KEY = "123456";'**)

👉🏼 You're done!🥳

✉️ **Feel free to contact me if you want to**

⚙️ **Next Update Goal:**  
🎯 Hide the API key to be able to build and deploy the website on GitHub pages
